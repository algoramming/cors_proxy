# CORS Proxy Server

A simple proxy server that helps bypass CORS restrictions when making API requests from your frontend applications.

## Live URL

üåê **Hosted on Vercel:** `https://algoramming-cors-proxy.vercel.app`

## How to Use

Simply use the proxy URL with your target API endpoint:

```
https://algoramming-cors-proxy.vercel.app/api/proxy?url=<your-target-url>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: This proxy server may behave unexpectedly as the file location structure has been modified. It is recommended to use only API endpoints and direct file locations for reliable operation.

### Simple API Requests

Replace your direct API calls with the proxy URL:

**Instead of:**
```javascript
fetch('http://api.example.com/data')
```

**Use:**
```javascript
fetch('https://algoramming-cors-proxy.vercel.app/api/proxy?url=http://api.example.com/data')
```

### Examples

**GET Request:**
```bash
curl "https://algoramming-cors-proxy.vercel.app/api/proxy?url=http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1"
```

**POST Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://algoramming-cors-proxy.vercel.app/api/proxy?url=http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Test Post", "body": "This is a test"}'
```

**JavaScript/Fetch:**
```javascript
// GET request
fetch('https://algoramming-cors-proxy.vercel.app/api/proxy?url=http://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));

// POST request
fetch('https://algoramming-cors-proxy.vercel.app/api/proxy?url=http://api.example.com/data', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ key: 'value' })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```
